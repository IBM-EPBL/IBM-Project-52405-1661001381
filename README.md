1.	INTRODUCTION

1.1	Project Overview :
To provide the right and plenty of opportunities to the fresher’s and experienced candidates. We have come up with a skill recommender solution through which the fresher or the skilled person can register, log in, and find jobs with our help according to their ability, skill level, and knowledge. In this process, we are going to help them in both a human- centered way and by using technology. Further will be discussed below.
1.2	Purpose 

To provide equal and appropriate job/skill recommendations to all the people with their ability, skill level, and knowledge consideration. We are not going to filter the candidates based on our machine-analyzed data that the candidate entered in the resume or wherever. Because we found that many peoples said they are not getting the right recommendations for jobs and skill enhancement courses. So, we are approaching this problem in a more human- centric way to get the data, processing, and recommend skills and jobs. We are merging both technology and human in the right proportion to solve the real human problem.

2.	LITERATURE SURVEY

2.1	Existing Problem
How might we recommend jobs for people's specific skills or interests and vice-versa? In the job searching world, Job description's explanation, advertising, and selection criteria aren’t the same during college and after college. It is entirely different. People are facing many practical issues when they searching jobs after their college days. As we are going to provide a different kind of job description alone will create a positive hopeful impact for fresher as well as experienced candidates. By this, we can satisfy both the fresher and experienced candidates who are all searching for jobs. As we are going to find the skills of the people through both the direct and indirect approach, we are able to get and find the right skill level for the people. In addition, we can get more insights about them. This creates a more positive impact and customer satisfaction in using our service and this is the existing problem to solve.
